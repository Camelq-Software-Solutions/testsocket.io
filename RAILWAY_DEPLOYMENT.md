# Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Issues
The Socket.IO server is currently returning 404 errors, which indicates the Railway deployment needs to be updated.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Update Railway Deployment
You need to redeploy your server to Railway with the updated code:

1. **Push your changes to your Git repository**
2. **Redeploy on Railway**:
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Railway should automatically detect changes and redeploy
   - Or manually trigger a redeploy

### 2. Verify Deployment
After redeployment, test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://testsocketio-roqet.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "connections": 0,
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

### 3. Test Socket.IO Connection
Run the test script:
```bash
node test_connection.js
```

### 4. Check React Native App
The app should now connect successfully. Check console logs for:
- âœ… Connection success messages
- ðŸ“¡ Transport information
- ðŸ”— Socket ID

## Configuration Changes Made

### Server (index.js)
- Added Express server with health endpoints
- Enhanced CORS configuration
- Added proper Socket.IO server configuration for Railway
- Added comprehensive event handlers

### Client (socket.ts)
- Simplified transport to polling only for Railway compatibility
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added connection status helpers
- Improved reconnection logic

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting 404:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify the deployment completed successfully
3. Wait a few minutes for propagation

### If connection fails:
1. Check Railway server logs
2. Verify the server is running on the correct port
3. Test with the provided test script

### If React Native app doesn't connect:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify the server URL is correct
3. Test with the test script first
